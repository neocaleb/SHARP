\usage{
sMetaC(
  rerowColor,
  sE1,
  folds,
  hmethod,
  finalN.cluster,
  minN.cluster,
  maxN.cluster,
  sil.thre,

}
\arguments{
\item{nC}{a m*n matrix, where m is the number of cells, n is the number of clustering algorithms, and the (i,j)-element of nC represents the cluter for the i-th cell by the j-th clutering predictor.}
}
\description{
This function is to do similarity-based ensemble clustering for combining the results from different partitions of single cells. The similarity is measured by the group-group correlations.

\examples{
finalrowColor = sMetaC(fColor, E1, folds, hmethod, N.cluster, minN.cluster, maxN.cluster, sil.thre, height.Ntimes)
