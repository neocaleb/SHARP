\title{weighted ensemble clustering}
\usage{
wMetaC(
  nC,
  hmethod,
  enN.cluster,
  minN.cluster,
  maxN.cluster,
  sil.thre,
  height.Ntimes
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nC}{a m*n matrix, where m is the number of cells, n is the number of clustering algorithms, and the (i,j)-element of nC represents the cluter for the i-th cell by the j-th clutering predictor.}
}
\description{
This function is to do weighted ensemble clustering for meta-clustering.
